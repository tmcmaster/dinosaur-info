# dinosaur-info
Collect and aggregate information about dinosaurs.

## Notes

The script in the bin directory should be run from within a temporary directory, for it writes 
into the current directory, and into a subdirectory called images (which it expects to be there).

This was just a quick project to gather some data on dinosaurs.
